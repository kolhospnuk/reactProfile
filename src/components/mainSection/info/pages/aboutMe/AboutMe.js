                My name is Anton. I am 27. I was born in Kropyvnytskyi.
                I studied at the Flight Academy. I am an aviation rescuer. But I don`t work by profession.
                My job is to update information about public transport on web resource. It's a good job,
                but my dream is to work in a big company as a programmer.
                Sometimes I play football and play the guitar.
